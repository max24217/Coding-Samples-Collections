Project 1 is the extension for lab 4. Instead of merely a static sphere, user now can use mouse to rotate the sphere. The sphere will rotate in the same direction as the user drags his mouse. In addition, if the user drag the sphere long enough and release the left button, the sphere will self rotate in the same direction as the drag direction.
