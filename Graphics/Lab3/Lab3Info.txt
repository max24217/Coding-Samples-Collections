The goal of lab3 was to handle the movement of different objects in a single scene at a time. In order to use self-programmed vertex shader and graphic pipeline, all rotation and other movement were implemented from the beginning of math itself. 

In current scene, there are four cubes with different colors rotating at different speed with different rotation orientation.
